This project creates a CSV file that contains 3 columns: ID, Word, Definition.
The console first starts and the user is allowed to add a word, delete a word by ID,
Modify a word and/or its definition, list all words, and look for 1 word.
For the sake of making it look like a terminal, I'm not going to list all the options.
Instead I'll just include an option "h", that'll list all the words.

At the end of the day, I made the layout of the whole project and got the AddWord
method to work. All I need to do is finish the others now.

Well, got them all working now. Listing and finding words weren't that bad.
Modifying and Deleting them however, required a little more thinking. Since
you cannot read and write files at the same time in Python, at least I don't
know as of now, I decided to write a temp file that would have the new changes
and if the process succeeded, rename that file dict.csv and delete the temp
file.

My next options are adding a few more features to refine the program:
1. You can only add a word once, if it already exists than the program won't add it.
2.
